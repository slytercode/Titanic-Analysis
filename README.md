Titanic Dataset Analysis
This project analyzes survival data from the Titanic dataset.
It explores the survival rate based on class, gender, and age group, offering insights through grouped statistics and visualizations.

About the Project
Data Source: Kaggle Titanic Training Dataset

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

Goal: Understand survival patterns by class, gender, and age group.

Main Steps
Data cleaning (removal of missing values, filling missing ages with the mean)

Creation of custom age groups: under 25, under 50, over 50

Analysis by class and gender

Correlation checks between variables and survival

Visualization of survival rates using bar plots

Files
Titanic_analysis.py — Python script containing the complete analysis and visualization.

requirements.txt — List of necessary libraries.

Notes
The analysis is purely educational and demonstrates skills in data cleaning, basic statistical analysis, and data visualization.

The dataset is used for learning purposes only.

Requirements
